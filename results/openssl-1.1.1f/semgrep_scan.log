Some files were skipped or only partially analyzed.
  Partially scanned: 338 files only partially analyzed due to parsing or internal Semgrep errors
  Scan skipped: 4 files not matching --include patterns, 1 files larger than 1.0 MB, 145 files matching .semgrepignore patterns
  For a full list of skipped files, run semgrep with the --verbose flag.

Ran 47 rules on 1109 files: 6570 findings.

A new version of Semgrep is available. See https://semgrep.dev/docs/upgrading
