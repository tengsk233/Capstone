# Capstone Project: A Framework for Automating Integrated SAT Vulnerability Detection in Multi-Language Programs

This repository contains the source code, scripts, and result files for our Capstone Project at Johns Hopkins Universityâ€™s MSSI program.  
The project aims to automate the integration of Static Analysis Tools (SATs) for analyzing software written in multiple programming languages.

## Project Description

As modern software systems become more complex and incorporate third-party libraries, the risk of introducing security vulnerabilities increases. This project aims to mitigate such risks by:

- Automatically identifying programming languages in codebases
- Selecting and running the appropriate SAT(s)
- Collecting and aggregating security-related outputs
- Comparing effectiveness, accuracy, and coverage of different SATs
- Packaging the entire framework into a reproducible Docker-based solution

## Key Features

- Multi-language SAT support
- Docker-based reproducibility
- Automated vulnerability detection pipeline
- Evaluation of SAT precision, coverage, and false positive rate
