Some files were skipped or only partially analyzed.
  Partially scanned: 106 files only partially analyzed due to parsing or internal Semgrep errors
  Scan skipped: 14 files matching .semgrepignore patterns
  For a full list of skipped files, run semgrep with the --verbose flag.

Ran 47 rules on 458 files: 11270 findings.

A new version of Semgrep is available. See https://semgrep.dev/docs/upgrading
